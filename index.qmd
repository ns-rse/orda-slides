## University Policy

> We aspire to open research culture that values a diverse range of contributions and adheres to the FAIR principles to
> enable the results of our research to be of maximum benefit to society (findable, accessible, interoperable and
> reusable), whilst also respecting circumstances that limit data sharing (for example, due to issues of privacy,
> non-consent, contractual agreements, legislation or practicality). - [University statement on Open Research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/openresearch/university-statement-open-research)

## University Commitment

Open Research practices are embeded in...

+ [University Vision](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/vision)

## Automate Uploading from GitHub

GitHub Workflow [release_to_ORDA](https://github.com/RSE-Sheffield/release_to_ORDA) well documented `README.md` (thanks
Bob :pray:)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
1. Create an Article on ORDA
2. Generate a `FIGSHARE_TOKEN`
3. Store `FIGSHARE_TOKEN` token in repository
4. Find `FIGSHARE_ARTICLE_ID`
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
5. Copy `ORDA.yaml` to repository, inserting `FIGSHARE_ARTICLE_ID`
6. Create a badge and add to `README.md`
7. Commit & push to GitHub
8. Create a release on GitHub
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Fortunately Bob Turner created the `releas_to_ORDA` repository which includes a GitHub Workflow file `ORDA.yaml` which
you can drop into your `.github/workflows/ORDA.yaml` and with a little configuration have release artefacts uploaded
from GitHub to ORDA automatically.

Its well documented with a comprehensive `README.md` that tells you all the steps you need to take.
:::


## Create an Article

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Required**

+ Authors
+ Title
+ Description
+ Licence
+ Ethics
+ Policy
+ Sharing and access restrictions
+ Methodology, headings and units

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Optional**

+ Funding
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Before you can automate uploads from GitHub you have to have an entry to which they are uploaded. Most fields are
obligatory and need completing, the only one that isn't is Funding.

Might need to be draft at this point :thinking:
:::

## Figshare Token

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
[How to get a Personal Token](https://help.figshare.com/article/how-to-get-a-personal-token)

+ Login to ORDA
+ _User Menu > Applications_
+ Create Personal Token
+ Description
+ Save
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
+ Repository _Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions_
+ Secrets Tab click _New repository secret_
+ Give it a name e.g. ORDA
+ Paste Token from ORDA in.
+ Add Secret
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Login to ORDA and from the User Menu select _Applications_, scroll down and you can _Create Personal Token_, add a
_Description_ and click on _Save_. As with most tokens these are only shown once so make sure to copy and save it
somewhere secure if you're not undertaking the next step immediately.
:::

## Figshare Article ID

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
+ Find the DOI
+ Figshare Article ID is the trailing number.
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.notes}
The Figshare article ID can be found on the article page you created on the right hand side.

## Copy & Edit `ORDA.yaml`

``` {.yaml code-line-numbers="27"}
name: Release to ORDA
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  release:
    types: [published]
jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      ARCHIVE_NAME: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}-${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
    steps:
      - name: prepare-data-folder
        run : mkdir 'data'
      - name: download-archive
        run: |
          curl -sL "${{ github.event.release.zipball_url }}" > "$ARCHIVE_NAME".zip
          curl -sL "${{ github.event.release.tarball_url }}" > "$ARCHIVE_NAME".tar.gz
      - name: move-archive
        run: |
          mv "$ARCHIVE_NAME".zip data/
          mv "$ARCHIVE_NAME".tar.gz data/
      - name: upload-to-figshare
        uses: figshare/github-upload-action@v1.1
        with:
          FIGSHARE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIGSHARE_TOKEN }}
          FIGSHARE_ENDPOINT: 'https://api.figshare.com/v2'
          FIGSHARE_ARTICLE_ID: 123456789  # Change this number!
          DATA_DIR: 'data'
```

::: {.notes}
This is easy, make a copy of the `ORDA.yaml` from the repository and save it in your repositories
`.github/workflows/ORDA.yaml`. Edit the value of `FIGSHARE_ARTICLE_ID`
:::

## Add badge to `README.md`

``` {.markdown}
[![ORDA](https://img.shields.io/badge/ORDA--DOI-10.123456%2Fshef.data.123456789.v.1-lightgrey)](https://figshare.shef.ac.uk/articles/software/TopoStats/123456789/1)
```

::: {.notes}
You can add a badge to you repositories `README.md` which makes it easier for people to find and cite your work, one of
the key ideas behind the FAIR principles. The URL for the badge will depend on your DOI and the link will depend on the
URL of your package on ORDA.

Once done stage and commit all changes, this will be the `README.md` you've just modified and adding the
`.github/workflows/ORDA.yaml`. Push these to GitHub.
